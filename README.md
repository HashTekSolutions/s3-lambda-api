## Serverless Architecture: 
This project leverages the power of serverless computing on AWS. It utilizes AWS Lambda functions to execute code without managing servers. This offers scalability, cost-efficiency, and faster development cycles.

## Architecture Diagram

Below is the architecture diagram representing the serverless setup:

## Components we used here:
# AWS Lambda Functions: 
The project utilizes two Lambda functions:
# Function 1 (Triggered by EventBridge): 
This function likely handles scheduled tasks. EventBridge, a serverless event bus, triggers this function based on a predefined schedule. The function might perform actions like data encryption using AWS KMS.
# Function 2 (Triggered by API Gateway):
This function handles user requests received through the API Gateway. It retrieves data, possibly fetching encrypted content from Amazon S3.
# Amazon S3:
This service acts as the storage layer. It securely stores the data objects in an encrypted format.
# AWS KMS: 
This service manages encryption keys used to secure the data at rest in S3. It ensures only authorized entities can access the data.
# API Gateway:
This service serves as the front door for user requests. It routes incoming requests to the appropriate Lambda function based on predefined configurations.

# Architectural Advantages
This serverless architecture offers several benefits:

# Scalability: 
AWS automatically scales the Lambda functions based on traffic, ensuring smooth operation even during high loads.
# Cost-Effectiveness:
You only pay for the resources you use. Since server management is eliminated, the infrastructure incurs minimal cost during idle periods.
# Increased Developer Agility:
Serverless development allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying about server provisioning and maintenance.

# Project Structure Analysis

The project leverages Terraform for infrastructure management. Terraform offers a declarative approach, where you define the desired infrastructure state, and Terraform provisions the resources accordingly.

# The folder structure promotes modularity and reusability:

modules/: This folder contains reusable Terraform modules for specific components like KMS, S3, Lambda, IAM (Identity and Access Management), and API Gateway. Each module likely encapsulates the configurations and resources needed for the respective service.
env/: This folder stores environment-specific configurations. It likely includes a subfolder for development (dev) and potentially other environments (e.g., staging, production). Each environment might have its own Terraform configuration files:
main.tf: The main Terraform configuration file defining the overall infrastructure for that environment.
variables.tf: This file defines variables used throughout the Terraform configuration. These variables can be customized for each environment.
outputs.tf: This file defines outputs generated by Terraform after applying the configuration. These outputs might include resource IDs or endpoints for verification.
providers.tf: This file specifies the Terraform providers used for interacting with AWS services. The development environment might use a specific provider version for testing purposes.

## Deployment Steps
The README outlines the deployment process using the Terraform CLI:

# Initialization: 
Run terraform init within the environment directory (e.g., env/dev) to initialize Terraform. This downloads and caches the necessary Terraform plugins required to interact with AWS services.
# Planning:
Run terraform plan to review the changes Terraform will make to your AWS infrastructure based on the current configuration. This allows you to identify any potential issues before applying the changes.
# Apply: 
If the plan looks good, run terraform apply to provision the infrastructure resources on AWS. This creates the S3 bucket, Lambda functions, IAM roles, and other resources as defined in the Terraform configuration.
# Verification: 
After successful deployment, use the provided endpoint URL (lambda_api_endpoint) to test the API functionality. This URL points to the specific Lambda function that retrieves data from S3.
# Important Note:
The provided endpoint URL is specific to the development environment of this project and might not be publicly accessible.

## In Conclusion

This detailed breakdown of the README.md provides a comprehensive understanding of the serverless infrastructure project on AWS. By leveraging serverless components and Terraform for infrastructure management, the project offers scalability, cost-efficiency, and faster development cycles. If you're tasked with managing this project, ensure you have the required AWS credentials and Terraform installed to proceed with deployments.



# AWS Serverless Infrastructure

## Overview

This documentation provides an overview and setup instructions for a serverless AWS infrastructure that uses AWS Lambda for computing, Amazon S3 for storage, and AWS KMS for encryption. An API Gateway serves as the entry point for user requests, triggering the Lambda functions.

## Architecture Diagram

Below is the architecture diagram representing the serverless setup:

The architecture includes the following components:
- **User**: Initiates the process by making a request to the API Gateway.
- **API Gateway**: Routes incoming user requests to the appropriate Lambda function.
- **Lambda Function 1**: Triggered by the EventBridge for scheduled tasks, such as encryption using KMS.
- **Lambda Function 2**: Handles user requests to retrieve data, fetching encrypted content from S3.
- **Amazon S3**: Stores encrypted data objects.
- **AWS KMS**: Manages encryption keys for securing data.
- **EventBridge**: Schedules and triggers Lambda Function 1.

```

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI with appropriate access rights.
- Terraform installed on your local machine.

### Steps
1. **Initialization**: Run `terraform init` within the environment directory to initialize Terraform.
2. **Plan**: Execute `terraform plan` to review the changes to be applied.
3. **Apply**: Use `terraform apply` to provision the resources on AWS.
4. **Verify**: After deployment, test the API using the provided endpoint URL.

you can use this url end point : lambda_api_endpoint = ** "https://mmt73opuqa.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/dev/retrieve_most_recent_object_dev" ** fet the latest s3 object
